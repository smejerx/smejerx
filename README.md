Hello :) I'm Szczepan - C programmer with most of my work experience on STM32 microcontrollers. Here I'm trying to learn some on software testing and gain experience in clear C programming, since I feel like I could use some learning in that topic.
In my free time I like to fly R/C airplanes, roller skating, and 3D printing.
I have no idea why do you read this, fellow earthling, but I hope you'll have a great day :)
